         <p>Diablo is whimsical but also very calculative when he wants to be. </p>

         <p>However, when one has a good relationship with Rimuru, Diablo usually treats them in an amiable way, though that does not mean he won't manipulate them for his own ends, "his own ends" usually referring to being close to Rimuru more often.</p>

         <p>As the overseer of the forest, Treyni possesses a certain dignity and level of grace befitting the role.</p>
         <p>She is well-spoken and intelligent, able to mediate between multiple parties with ease. </p>
         <p>Beneath that exterior, however, is a childish and emotional person, much like her master, Ramiris.</p>
         <p>Whenever she's around Ramiris, she tends to show her true self and spoils her excessively, greatly stressing out Beretta the only sense of reason within the trio.</p>
         <p>Her personality is virtually identical to Rimuru Tempest, as commented by him, except she's way more skilled in avoiding commitments and passing on any troublesome responsibilities to others.</p>

         <p>She is a pleasant person. Though one doesn't feel a shred of a Demon Lord's dignity from her, she is nonetheless a pleasant person.</p>
         <p>Also, she is completely oblivious to her complete lack of a presence. </p>
         <p>Without listening to others at all, she just says whatever she feels like saying.</p>
         <p>She is a ridiculously free-willed individual. </p>
         <p>She acts a little smug due to being both the Elemental Queen and a Demon Lord but has no problem in helping Rimuru after finding out why he went to the labyrinth.</p>

         </figure>
         <p>Milim, by nature, is a rather childish and outspoken individual.</p>
         <p>She isn't afraid to speak her mind and throws away any pretense of formalities. This, however, shouldn't be mistaken as her having the mind of a child. </p>
         <p>Those who can look past her childish demeanor will find a fierce, extremely intelligent woman who cannot be tricked or outsmarted even by the brightest minds.</p>
         <p>Despite this intellect, her tendency to be inconsiderate of other people and do whatever she wants often results in her overlooking the complexity and importance of a situation entirely, in favor of a more straight-forward approach.</p>
         <p>She is also extremely sensitive to gossip, especially when it relates to her, and anybody that insults or underestimates her often ends up dead or close to it as a result.</p>
         <p> She also dislikes ruling and constantly neglects her duty to instead find ways to entertain herself.</p>
         <p>She also likes Honey, which Rimuru uses to tame her.</p>
